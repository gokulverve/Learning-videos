00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:03,650
<v ->Welcome to the first section of the course.</v>

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:05,170
And in this section you're gonna learn

3
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:07,970
the very basics of the Javascript language.

4
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:10,670
Things like variables, data types, functions,

5
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:13,220
objects, erase, and many other things

6
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:15,340
that are part of the Javascript language.

7
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:17,030
And the best part is that you're actually

8
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:19,040
not just gonna learn Javascript itself

9
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:21,550
but at the same time the fundamentals of programming

10
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:22,960
in general.

11
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,800
Now later in the course we're actually gonna come back

12
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,520
to many of these fundamentals.

13
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:30,238
But for now, I just want you to get a quick overview

14
00:00:30,238 --> 00:00:33,400
of how the language works and get your hands dirty

15
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,680
with some coding.

16
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,100
So this part of the course is really not about

17
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:38,990
making things look pretty in a browser

18
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:40,410
or anything like that.

19
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:42,370
Right now we just wanna focus on

20
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:44,830
the Javascript language itself and then the rest

21
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:46,090
will come later.

22
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:46,923
All right.

23
00:00:46,923 --> 00:00:49,053
So let's go start this journey right now.
